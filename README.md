## Potential plan

1. What is rxjs ? 

     Imperative = How we want to do something

     Declarative = What we want, what something is 

2. What does it look like in Angular ? [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skOTEbGwncE)

3. Should we absolutely avoid manually subscribing to Angular ? [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvMxnGfqEis)

4. rxjs (search, routing, formControle ...) 

5. Signals

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
